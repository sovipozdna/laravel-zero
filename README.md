## What is A Level Physics?
     
A Level Physics is a qualification that is offered by various examination boards in the United Kingdom, such as AQA, OCR, Edexcel, and CIE. It is equivalent to the second year of a two-year college course in physics, and it is usually taken by students who are 16 to 18 years old. A Level Physics is a prerequisite for many university courses in physics, engineering, mathematics, and other related fields. A Level Physics consists of two parts: AS Level and A2 Level. AS Level covers the basic principles and applications of physics, while A2 Level covers more advanced topics and concepts.
